## Overview

D3 is a library that has been around for a long time. It's more of a toolkit for making visualizations with JavaScript. It's the first name that comes when conversation turns to making data visualizations with JS.

## Why you should know this

It's the tool that wrote the book on data visualization with JS. You can do just about anything with D3. It has huge flexibility and deep toolset.

## Learning Objectives

- Identify use cases for D3
- Define data used by D3
- Create simple visualizations with D3

## D3

D3 - Data Driven Documents describes itself as:

> D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS. D3’s emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation.

What does it do? Data visualization! You could say D3 wrote the book on data visualization with JavaScript.

## How does it work?

D3 does so much it's hard to answer that. It draws things from data. It binds to data, meaning it will update when the data changes. It handles animation and interactions. It can load data and manipulate the DOM.

D3 is more of a toolbox with tools that are focussed on drawing things on the screen from a datasets.

## Explore D3.

Go to the [D3 hompage](https://d3js.org), and take a look at the examples on the D3 home and [examples pages](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Gallery).

**Find an example that you think is interesting to show to the group and answer the question: _why is this interesting?_**

D3 is complex. With that complexity comes a lot of flexibility. Expect a steep learning curve!
