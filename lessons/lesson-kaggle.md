## What should you look for? 

You can make a visualization from any dataset. Some datasets will be easier to work with than others. Here are few things to look for: 

- **Size** - Best to choose a dataset that is a smaller size. You can planning to make a web page, the data you display needs to be loaded into that page. Larger files make your site slower. You can extract a smaller set from a larger set but that will take more effort! Also, larger datasets will take longer for your browser code to process! Best to choose something that is less than a few megabytes. 
- **File Format** - D3 can load several formats. The two most common that you'll find on Kaggle are json and CSV. Look for these to make your workflow easiest. 
- **Filter your search** - Kaggle has a Filter option, its a button on the right of the search box. Use this to filter for datasets that are JSON, CSV, and have a max file size of 4 megabytes.
