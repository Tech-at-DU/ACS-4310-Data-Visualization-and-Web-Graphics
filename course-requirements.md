# ACS 4310 Data Visualization Course Requirements

This course will follow a self directed learning model. Think of this as working as a junior engineer. You'll have projects that you are responsible for and weekly meetings with your co-working group. 

## What you will learn

In this course you will learn to create data visualizations by making three data visualizations.

### What is a data visualization? 

A data visualization takes data and turns it into one or more images. These images might even be intercative, be animated, or change in real time! 

Data visualizations ask a question and the image reveals a story. The goal is to reveal insight and understanding to what may have started an incomprehensible list of numbers and other values. 

### Why learn this? 

It's fun, it's interesting, its a job skill. You'll practice your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills in new and interesting ways! 

## Projects 

You will be responsible for creating solving some practice warmup problems, tutorials, creating three data visualizations, and solving the final assessment problem. 

You can choose to visualize any three datasets you like. I have some datasets I can recommend if you're you're unsure of what to work with. 

### Warmup problems

The warm uo problems deal with the Titanic dataset. These problems deal strictly with extracting relevant values from the dataset.

### D3 Tutorials

In order to create a visualizations you need to learn the tools and techniques. I have some tutorials you can work through. You can work on these until you feel you have the skills to create the visualization you want to create. 

Tutorials: 

- D3 tutorials - https://github.com/Tech-at-DU/d3-tutorial

### Three Data Visualizations

You will create three data visualizations, each which must meet the following criteria. 

- Asks three questions of the dataset with the goal of telling story or revealing meaning from the dataset. For example the Titanic dataset might ask: 
	- How Many passengers lived and how many died by gender? 
	- How many passengers lived and died by passenger class? 
	- Sort passengers by number of siblings
	- This might tell a story of: what factors affect survival for passengers on the Titanic. 
- Answers the questions with one or more visualization. For the questions above you might create two bargraphs and a histogram. 

### Final assessment

The final assessment will be similar to a practical interview question. You will create a visualization using a dataset provided, with the goal of answering the questions provided. 

## Resources

### Finding a dataset

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets# is like GitHub for datasets. It's the go to place if you're searching for data!

### Choosing a dataset

Besides choosing something that is interesting to you you will want to choose a dataset that is possible to easily visualize. 

**Format**: Find a dataset in a format you can work with. If you're using D3 you can import JSON, CSV, SV, and XML. If you're using HTML, CSS, and JS you may want to stick with JSON though other formats will still work. 

**Size**: Datasets can often be large. Since your goal is to display the dataset visually in a browser you will want a dataset that you can load into a browser without excessive preprocessing. If you can choose a dataset 1 megabyte or smaller. 

_You can search Kaggle.com and filter on format and file size._

### Visualizations 

How many ways can you visualize data? What type visualization works best for type of data? These are great questions. Check these:
